Paper title: Stochastic Variance Reduced Primal Dual Algorithms for Empirical Composition Optimization, NeurIPS, 2019.

The code here is a re-implementation of the algorithms based on the description of the NeurIPS 2019 paper.

Instructions: Create a sub-folder 'results' in the home folder before running the main code; This sub-folder is where
all the experimental results will be saved.
